Proposal: Data Analytics & Transcription Error Analysis for ASR Improvement
Objective:
To develop a structured learning-based approach where students analyze and refine ASR-generated transcriptions, categorize audio quality, and provide valuable insights for improving ASR accuracy.

Project Scope & Methodology
1️⃣ Data Categorization & Quality Assessment
Students will manually assess and categorize transcribed audios into three distinct classes:

🔹 Category 1: Noisy Audio

Audio where noise significantly affects intelligibility.

Requires additional denoising or preprocessing.

🔹 Category 2: Poor Quality Speech (Without Noise)

Audio that is not noisy but still difficult for ASR to transcribe correctly (e.g., unclear pronunciation, muffled speech, low volume).

🔹 Category 3: Clean & Audible Audio

Clear speech that an ASR should transcribe accurately.

✅ Learning Outcome: Students gain expertise in identifying ASR vulnerabilities based on audio characteristics.

2️⃣ Transcription Correction & Error Analysis
Students will correct ASR-generated transcriptions and track different types of errors:

🔹 Word Error Rate (WER) Breakdown:

Substitutions (incorrect word used)

Insertions (extra words added)

Deletions (missing words)

🔹 Pronunciation-Based Errors:

Identifying patterns where ASR mishears similar-sounding words.

🔹 Hallucination Analysis:

Cases where ASR completely fabricates words instead of transcribing actual speech.

✅ Learning Outcome:

Students will understand how ASR models fail in different scenarios.

They will identify common failure patterns, making this analysis valuable for future ASR improvements.

3️⃣ Model Adaptation Strategy (Advanced Task)
For students with a machine learning background, additional research-based tasks can be included:

🔹 Feature Extraction:

Identify patterns where certain phonemes or accents cause errors.

Track errors based on speaker gender, age, or dialect.

🔹 Model Improvement Recommendations:

Suggest fine-tuning parameters based on error analysis.

Evaluate whether Ensembling or preprocessing techniques (e.g., noise reduction) would be more beneficial.

✅ Learning Outcome:

Students gain hands-on exposure to practical ASR improvements without needing full-scale fine-tuning.

4️⃣ Insights & Reporting
Students will generate data-driven reports with the following:
📊 Statistical Insights:

Breakdown of error distribution per category.

How often certain words get misrecognized.

📈 Visualization & Trend Analysis:

Graphs showcasing WER variations across different audio types.

Common misrecognized words and their frequency.

📌 Recommendations & Observations:

What ASR fails at most often (e.g., numbers, names, slang, accents).

Possible strategies to improve accuracy (e.g., pre-filtering low-quality audio before ASR processing).

✅ Learning Outcome:

Develops critical thinking and data analytics skills.

Provides real-world insights to enhance ASR technology.

Final Benefits of the Proposal
✅ Students Get Practical Learning

Exposure to speech recognition challenges and ML-based transcription systems.

Gain data analysis, NLP, and software tool experience (Audacity, Praat, Python for analytics).

✅ Valuable for ASR Model Developers

Provides high-quality insights instead of just raw transcriptions.

Helps refine data collection strategies for future ASR improvements.

✅ Government Officials Get Structured Data

Instead of wasting effort on endless manual transcriptions, this provides structured, labeled data that is genuinely useful for ASR enhancement.

Conclusion
This proposal ensures that:
1️⃣ Students gain practical knowledge & useful ML exposure.
2️⃣ ASR models receive structured insights for future improvements.
3️⃣ It prevents the project from being reduced to mere data-entry work.
4️⃣ The government gets high-quality data analysis instead of just transcripts.

🎯 This approach balances learning, innovation, and real-world impact! 🚀
