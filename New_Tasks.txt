Minimizing the wer:

1) Pick up only 100% accurate ground truths from the overall 22 hrs manual transcriptions.
2) Apply Spelling correction algorithm by giving prompt to Llama3.1 on Predicted Output by taking reference from Actual Output
3) After this, ask Llama to minimize wer using DP or to reach this state: Predicted Output == subsequence (Actual Output)
4) Then find the WER
